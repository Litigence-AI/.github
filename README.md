# Litigence AI

## Overview
Litigence AI is a legal information platform designed to empower underserved communities by providing quick, personalized legal guidance grounded in Indian law. Our mission is to bridge the gap in legal awareness, especially for children, by offering accessible and user-friendly tools.

## Founder Journey
"I grew up in a community where people often lacked awareness about their legal rights—especially for children—due to cost, time, and limited education. As a result, crimes go unreported and issues like student abuse remain hidden. To change this, I’m developing an AI-driven legal tool that offers quick, personalized guidance to empower underserved communities."
